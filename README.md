# Automated auditory trigger detection for YouTube
Imagine settling down to watch a Youtube video, only to be jolted by a sudden distressing sound like a gunshot or loud crash. For some of us, we might be left feeling uneasy or overwhelmed. For many in the neurodivergent community, these moments aren’t just uncomfortable; they can cause intense stress or sensory overload, turning what should be an enjoyable experience into something distressing. Yet, there’s no solution right now to help viewers manage or avoid these specific triggers in real time. This gap means millions are left watching with the constant worry of unexpected, disruptive sounds spoiling their experience.
Our tool is designed to address this need by automatically detecting audio triggers in YouTube videos and providing real-time warnings. By alerting viewers to potentially distressing sounds, we’re empowering individuals with sensory sensitivities to engage with content comfortably, tailoring YouTube to meet their unique needs. Beyond inclusivity, we’re working to create a platform that respects emotional well-being, giving creators the freedom to share responsibly and platforms the means to protect viewers without limiting creative expression.
